# Code Explanation of `server.js`

## 1. Express
- **Purpose**: We use **Express** to create a server that handles HTTP requests and routes efficiently.

## 2. File System (fs)
- **Purpose**: The **File System module** (`fs`) is utilized to interact with the file system, enabling reading and writing of files.

## 3. Child Process
- **Purpose**: The **Child Process module** allows us to execute system commands, specifically for interacting with Docker.

## 4. Writing User Code to File
```javascript
fs.writeFileSync('user_code.py', code);
```
- **Functionality**: This line copies the content of the `code` variable into a file named `user_code.py`.
  - If `user_code.py` **does not exist**, it will be created.
  - If `user_code.py` **already exists**, its contents will be completely overwritten with the new content from the `code` variable.

## 5. Writing Dockerfile Content
- In a similar manner, we define the content of the Dockerfile and use `fs.writeFileSync` to copy it into a file named `Dockerfile`.

## 6. Executing Child Processes

### First Child Process
- **Command**: The first child process executes the command to build a Docker image from the Dockerfile:
  ```javascript
  exec('docker build -t user-code .', (buildError, buildStdout, buildStderr) => {
      // Error handling and response
  });
  ```
  - **Functionality**: This command instructs Docker to create an image tagged as `user-code` using the Dockerfile located in the current directory.

### Second Child Process
- **Command**: The second child process executes the command to run a Docker container based on the newly built image:
  ```javascript
  exec('docker run --rm user-code', (runError, runStdout, runStderr) => {
      // Error handling and response
  });
  ```
  - **Functionality**: This command runs the `user-code` image as a container, executing the code written in `user_code.py`. The `--rm` flag ensures that the container is removed after it stops, keeping the system clean.

## Summary
This server setup provides a mechanism for users to submit code, which is then written to a file and executed inside a Docker container. The use of Express for server management, `fs` for file handling, and `child_process` for executing Docker commands creates a robust environment for running user-submitted code safely and efficiently.
